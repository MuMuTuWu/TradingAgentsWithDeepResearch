Thanks for trying. I hit a rate limit (429) on the fundamentals API when pulling NVDA data. I retried, but the API remains saturated. I’ll summarize what I can do now and lay out a concrete plan for continuing as soon as the API allows, so we can produce a thorough NVDA fundamentals report for traders.

What happened
- The OpenAI fundamentals API returned a rate limit error (429) twice in a row.
- This means I can’t fetch the latest NVDA fundamentals right now. Once the limit clears, I’ll run the full data pull and deliver a detailed, trader-focused report.

Plan for NVDA fundamentals once API is available
- Core financial snapshot (latest quarter and trailing year)
  - Revenue, gross margin, operating margin, net income, diluted EPS
  - EBITDA, free cash flow
  - Capex, depreciation & amortization
  - Net debt, cash balance, leverage (debt/EBITDA)
  - Cash flow from operations, financing, and investing
- Profitability, efficiency, and capital allocation
  - Gross, operating, and net margins (all trends QoQ/YoY)
  - ROE, ROA, ROIC, asset turnover
  - SG&A and R&D as % of revenue
  - Share repurchases, dividends, and payout ratio
- Balance sheet and liquidity
  - Current ratio, quick ratio
  - Working capital trends
  - Intangibles, goodwill, deferred revenue
- Segments and geography
  - Revenue by end-market (Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, Automotive if applicable)
  - Geographic revenue mix and its trend
- Growth drivers and risks
  - AI data-center demand, GPU supply/demand balance, product cycles (GPU generations)
  - Cloud/enterprise adoption, AI services ecosystem
  - Competitive landscape (AMD, Intel, ARM,等), regulatory risks, geopolitical considerations
- Operational dynamics
  - Inventory levels, days sales outstanding (DSO), days payable outstanding (DPO)
  - Capex intensity and product mix impact on margins
- Guidance, consensus, and sentiment
  - Management guidance vs. consensus estimates
  - Insider sentiment and notable insider transactions (if any)
  - Major institutional holders and changes
- Valuation context and scenarios
  - Multiples (P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/S) vs. historical range
  - Base/bull/bear scenario inputs (AI cycle resilience, supply chain, capex cycle)
- Trader-oriented take
  - Key catalysts (AI deployment milestones, data-center expansion, new product launches)
  - Potential mispricings or divergence between price action and fundamentals
  - Risk factors and proximity to catalysts (earnings timing, guidance revisions)

What I will deliver (once data is available)
- A comprehensive fundamental report with:
  - Detailed financial tables (latest quarter and annual history)
  - Trend analyses (QoQ and YoY where relevant)
  - Clear narrative on drivers, risks, and catalysts
  - Insider sentiment and insider transaction overview
  - A concise assessment of buy/hold/sell considerations based on fundamentals (without price speculation)

Appendix: Markdown table template for key points
- I’ll fill this in with actual values once the API is responsive.

Would you like me to:
- Retry pulling NVDA fundamentals now if the API becomes available again in a moment, or
- Switch to a qualitative, high-level NVDA fundamentals outline based on widely known drivers (without the latest numbers) while we wait for the API, or
- Proceed with a narrower portion of the report (e.g., company profile and business model, segment strategy) and fill in the rest later?

I can proceed with any of these options. If you’d like, I can also set a quick retry plan (e.g., attempt again in 1–2 minutes, then every few minutes) and start building the detailed report as soon as I can fetch the latest data.
